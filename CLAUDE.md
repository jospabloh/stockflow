## Base44

This app's data models live as schema-as-code in `base44/entities/*.jsonc`, but
the running app reads/writes against the **deployed** schema in the Base44
backend — the two can drift.

**Always, when working with Base44:** whenever you add or change a field in a
`base44/entities/*.jsonc` file, make sure that schema change is actually
**deployed to the Base44 backend** — don't assume committing the `.jsonc` is
enough. If a schema field only exists in the repo and not in the deployed
schema, Base44 **silently drops** that field on create/update: the record saves
but the new field never persists (no error is thrown). Verify the deployed
schema (e.g. via the Base44 MCP `list_entity_schemas`) and deploy/update it
(`update_entity_schema`) when it's missing the field.

Symptom of this class of bug: a record saves successfully but one specific
field never sticks and reverts to blank on reload.

> Reference: this exact issue caused the "Pagos a Proveedores" invoice-status
> (semáforo) not to save — the `invoice_status` field was in the repo `.jsonc`
> but missing from the deployed `SupplierPayment` schema.
